## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

One of the ways that this challenge encouraged you to test yourself was:

>The font sizes in this project are slightly smaller in the mobile layout. Find a way to reduce font size for smaller screens without using media queries.

My solution to this was to use the `clamp()` function in my CSS. This was my actually my first experience with it but I found it very useful!

**Basic Syntax**

```
clamp(min, val, max)
```

**Example from my code**
```css
h2 {
  color: var(--black);
  font-size: clamp(1.25rem, 2vw, 1.5rem);
  font-style: normal;
  line-height: 150%; /* 36px */
}
```
